category<br />They do weekly shelf counts<br />?????<br />Seems like a red herring<br />Some statistics get value from frequency<br />&ldquo;You guys realize&rdquo;<br />They would like to see adjustable scope <br />Daily increments as much as they want<br />Metrics on how often stock is hitting 0<br />POS<br />When you scan a barcode it asks the database how much the item is right now<br />Inventory system not related to prices<br />Pricing not done store to store, nationwide - so it&rsquo;s not really our problem<br />Databases<br />More localized<br />Does it need to be scaled?<br />Does not need to be scaled up<br />There&rsquo;s a lot of data in there that they would like not to migrate<br />We have space on the database<br />Each store has a table in its database<br />They all connect to the nationwide one<br />The program will use an identifier during accessing which tells the db which tables it wants<br />If a random employee says that 300 high value items SUDDENLY WENT BAD then they would like to know which employee did that<br />The app will have a login<br />Ipad stays in the store<br />Forced logout &ldquo;if an employee is careless&rdquo;<br />Inactive after a couple minutes<br />Maybe we can have a lower overhead login process for when you&rsquo;ve been LOGGED IN <br />NFC Stuff as an option<br />Employees currently have magnetic cards<br />They use it for the punch system and they swipe <br />Just a pin<br />The 4 in 10000 seems free<br /><br /><br /><br />When the internet is out<br />When things are entered they shoudl be cached until the network is back online and then everything is pushed<br />Can&rsquo;t have restocking stuff lost due to connectivity is not ok<br />Receiving can be ID by an invoice number or something which lets you cross reference <br />The database will have invoice number<br /><br /><br />Facing<br />Don&rsquo;t want it to look like it&rsquo;s slim pickings<br />How do you restock items sold based on weight?<br />Not every carrot is getting scanned or being put into the system<br />Produce can be <br />There are scales in the back <br />They need to be able to enter weight or remove weight ***<br />THE SYSTEM HAS TO SUPPORT BOTH WAYS OF SELLING ITEMS: weight and by the item<br />A SLIDING SCALE FOR MANAGERS IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGE OF SHELF CAPACITY<br />Be able to update capacity<br />They are expecting setup overhead<br />But ultimately it&rsquo;s pretty configurable <br />Managers can define &ldquo;shelf&rdquo; capacity by either weight or count<br />import/export csv<br />Especially for defining shelf capacities<br />Mobile app has to communicate with <br />They have a website that is essentially just an ad and is useless<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Corporate can log into the app<br />Is the store making money?<br />What products are making money?<br />Read only visualizations and raw data<br />They have logins with view only access<br />Managers get read/write access<br />How do you add new managers?<br />All hiring and promotions go through head office anyway so IT would take care of elevating privileges and etc<br />Have a table of &ldquo;this is their name and this is their data and role and job etc&rdquo;<br />They want logins to go through the database at corporate <br />When there&rsquo;s an internet outage, data doesn&rsquo;t leak</div>
